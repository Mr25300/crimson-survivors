Overall: No cheeky quotes this time. I've gone through the code (or at least as much as I could). It's not perfect, but that is if I were to assess you by industry standards. Even then, I have little to criticize.
If I did, I would mostly be pulling straws. The OOP design could be improved, but that takes experience. This is already splendid.

Impressive isn't a word that begins to describe a project like this. Impressed is feeling that pales in comparison to the feeling I have for your accomplishment. This is a great product.

To quote Ali: "Mr. Ma will give you 100 anyways." Yes, but it's deserved. This is definitely the best code and product I've seen in my years teaching this course. You don't need the bonuses, take your nat 100.
